# This file is to create a (multi-class) classifier to identify 
# fruits in the fruit360 dataset. 
# 
# We will use: 
#   A pretrained VGG model; 
#   Transfer learning to train the classifier (following the VGG
# model). 
# Keras in tensorflow 2.0 will be used as the library for deep 
# learning.
